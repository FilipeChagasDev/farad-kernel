# kernel.f
(Kernel-dot-F) Multitask kernel project

# Build/Debug dependencies

* Some GNU-Linux OS
* aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc (GCC for ARM64)
* Python 3
* qemu-system-aarch64 (QEMU for ARM64, just for kernel emulation)

## Build

Right after cloning the repository, if the bin and obj directories do not exist, the following command must be executed:

```sh
./init.sh
```

The following command compiles the kernel and generates the kernel8.img file in the bin directory:

```sh
python3 build.py
```

The following command starts the emulation:

```sh
./qemurpi3.sh
```
## Debug

Right after cloning the repository, if the bin and obj directories do not exist, the following command must be executed:

```sh
./init.sh
```

The following command compiles the kernel and generates the kernel8.img file in the bin directory with debug features enabled and starts qemu:

```sh
python3 debug.py
```
